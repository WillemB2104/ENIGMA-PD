## Linear mixed model mega-analyses for the ENIGMA Panic Disorder working group

These scripts are intended for the batch processing of multiple linear mixed effect models for the ENIGMA Panic Disorder working group. 

Scripts were adapted from the work of Max Laansma (ENIGMA-Parkinson's Disorder Working Group) and existing ENIGMA scripts for multiple linear models see: https://github.com/ENIGMA-git/ENIGMADiseaseWorkingGroupStats
